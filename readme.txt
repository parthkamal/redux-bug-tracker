in this project i will make a javascript application for tracking bugs with nodejs as backend and redux as the state management library
redux is a state management library build specially for javascript application
redux makes an object called store for the app which acts as an database for the frontend 
redux makes all the components of the ui to be in sync


pros of redux in an application
predictable state changes
centralized state
easy debugging
preserve page state
undo/redo 
ecosystem of add-ons

const of redux in an application 
complexity-redux requires the use of functional programming which increases the complexity of the application 
verbosity-using redux in an app always requires some boilerplate code to initialize

redux is build on top of functional programming concepts

pure functions
no random values 
no current date/time 
no global  state
no mutation of parameters


benefits of pure functions
self documenting
easily testable
concurrency
cacheable
