in this project i will make a javascript application for tracking bugs with nodejs as backend and redux as the state management library
redux is a state management library build specially for javascript application
redux makes an object called store for the app which acts as an database for the frontend 
redux makes all the components of the ui to be in sync


pros of redux in an application
predictable state changes
centralized state
easy debugging
preserve page state
undo/redo 
ecosystem of add-ons
